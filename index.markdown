My name is Trevor and this is my website. I am currently a senior at Allegheny College,
and I graduate in May 2021. I study International Relations and Political Science,
however my skills expand into non-profit economics, development, research, marketing,
and French.

In my free time I enjoy cooking, running, reading, and camping. Get to know me by reading what I have to say in my blog.
